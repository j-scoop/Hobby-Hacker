# Hobby Hacker

Hobby Hacker is a web app that allows people to log and keep track of their hobbies. Create a login, then enter some hobbies to keep track of.
You may then navigate to the individual hobby pages and enter time spent on your hobby. The app will then generate a graph, displaying your data,
of which you can adjust the timescale. You may hide your past hobbies by setting them to 'Archived'. This will remove them from the main view.
You may also delete your hobbies if they are no longer needed.
